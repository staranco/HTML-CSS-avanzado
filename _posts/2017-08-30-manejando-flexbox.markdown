El diseño de páginas web tiende a seguir siempre estructuras similares, y una de las partes más complejas del aprendizaje y uso de CSS es saber cuándo y cómo emplear las diferentes propiedades como floats, displays y posicionamientos. Uno de los usos más extendidos es el de diseñar a partir de una cuadrícula o *grid* formada por columnas y filas de igual tamaño (normalmente se usa la medida de 12 columnas ya que esta es una cifra fácilmente divisible entre 2) 

<!-- [Narrator] The flexible box layout, or flexbox for short, includes many options for aligning elements and creating flexible items. This layout model is supported by all major modern browsers. Internet Explorer 11 has partial support and there is no support in any previous version. So as long as you don't have to support older versions of Internet Explorer, you're good to go with flexbox. Let's take a look at an example. To use flexbox, the first thing you need to do is set the display value to flex to initiate the flex layout.

So let's go ahead and uncomment out line three and run the code. This will align the elements and automatically size the flex items based on the content contained within. You can still set a specific width to the flex items if you want them to be equally sized. So here in my flex item CSS block, I'll add my width in of 20%. So now they are equally sized. Notice that the border around each item extends the same width and height for each item.

When using traditional techniques like float, each item is the same height as its content and required additional hacks to make them equal height columns. So using flex makes it much easier since it automatically sets the height of each flex item to be the same as the largest item without any additional CSS. With flexbox, you can also change the direction of the items without changing the HTML markup. Let's go back to our flex container block and add in the flex-direction property with the value of row-reverse.

Let's go ahead and run that update and as you can see the content blocks have reversed even though the HTML remains the same. We can also change the flex-direction value to column. This will change the items from rows to columns and there you have it. I'm going to change my values back to the default settings. Another useful flexbox layout property is justify-content for distributing extra space around the elements. Let's suppose we only had items three to five.

Let's comment out one and two, just so that we have some extra space. I'm going to comment it out on the HTML side and run the code. Now we can set the value of justify-content in line 5 to flex-end and this will align the boxes to the right or we can set the value to center and this center align the elements. There are two more options, space-between and space-around.

Let's try space-between first and then let's see the difference between space-between and space-around. So just like the new grid layout discussed in the previous lesson, there are lots of new properties and concepts introduced with the flexbox layout. We've looked at just a few to get started. To learn more, here are some resources. CSS Reference is good resource if you want more of a quick reference guide. It shows the different properties with examples.

If you want a more in-depth resource, check out Codrops. In addition to examples, there are more explanations around how each property works. And here's a comparison article between using grid and flexbox for different layout scenarios.-->
